Changelog:
  * 13-Set-2013: version 1.0 release, based on the onboard motherboard
  * 10-Set-2014: version 2.0 release, standalone version;
                 re-structured packages and added a README file

1. INTRODUCTION

This folder contains five packages for ROS, as rosbuild packages, that
provide a standard interface for the Nomadic Scout robot, costumized
by IDMind. It assumes that the computer running these drivers is
connected to the motor drivers either directly via two serial ports,
or using two USB-Serial converters.

2. INSTALLATION

Follow these steps to install these drivers:
   i) let ROS_PACKAGES_PATH include the folder containing these
      packages
   ii) build the drivers using the command "rosmake scout_driver scout_odometry"

3. USAGE

The scout_launch contains a launch file that runs all relevant nodes,
that is, the command "roslaunch scout_launch scout.launch" starts
everthing, including loading the necessary parameters.

IMPORTANT: this launch file takes as arguments the device drivers
corresponding to the devices where the motor controllers are attached
to. This can be changed either directly on the launch file, or on the
roslaunch command line, e.g.
"roslaunch scout_launch scout.launch motor0:=/dev/ttyUSB1 motor1:=/dev/ttyUSB0"

The interface provided by these drivers includes motor commands
through the standard /cmd_vel topic and odometry through the standard
TF scheme.

4. PACKAGES

These drivers include these packages:
  * scout_config -- contains a YAML file with the kinematic parameters
    of the Scout. These can be changed to improve wheel odometry.
  * scout_driver -- contains the low-level hardware drivers, including
    the velocity convertion node and an interface to a joystick.
  * scout_launch -- contains the launch file to launch all nodes
  * scout_msgs -- contains the definition of some custom message
    formats (only relevant for the low level drivers)
  * scout_odometry -- contains a node to compute odometry

5. NODES

Once launched, these nodes are running:
  * motors -- low-level drivers to the robot motors
  * joy -- joystick driver
  * joydrive -- commands the robot motors via joystick commands
  * odometry_node -- publishes as a TF the robot odometry, that is, a
    transformation from frame /odom to frame /base_link
  * scout_move_base_interface -- converts motion commands in /cmd_vel
    topic into low-level motor commands

6. PARAMETERS

The kinematic parameters are set in the file scout_config/scout.yaml.
These are:
  * LAMBDA_L -- ticks per meter for the Left wheel
  * LAMBDA_R -- ticks per meter for the Right wheel
  * L -- distance (in meters) between wheels
