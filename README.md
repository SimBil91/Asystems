# "Autonomous Systems" at IST, Lisbon, Portugal

## Team Scout 1

After creating a 2D map of the floor using a Hokuyo lidar, the robot can navigate to a location autonomously.
Control of the robot is done by a remote human operator using gestures only. Of course, the robot is able to speak ;) .

See the demonstrational video of the final system here:
